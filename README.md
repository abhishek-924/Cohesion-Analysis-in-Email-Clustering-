# Cohesion-Analysis-in-Email-Clustering
This project involves clustering of emails and finding similarity between the clusters.

The Enron Email Dataset is collected and prepared by the CALO Project (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). It contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron, organized into folders. The corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages. The original data included approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation out of which we only use 10,000 emails. 
In this project, the dataset containing 10,000 emails is collected and a data frame is created using pandas library. The raw message is parsed into the key-value pair. To work with only the sender, receiver and email body data, a function is initialized that extracts these data into key-value pairs. Removal of stop words is done along with stemming. Next, the email bodies are converted into a document-term matrix using TF-IDF. A quick plot to visualize this matrix is made by creating a 2d representation of the DTM (document-term matrix). The next step was writing a function to get the top TF-IDF features out of all the emails. Using document vectors, clustering is done using KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering and cmeans clustering algorithm. Then the cohesion score is calculated for each cluster of each algorithm by using cosine similarity and the results are compared.
